Image Quality Filter
====================
Conservative filter — only removes CLEARLY bad images.

Philosophy:
  Photogrammetry loves overlap.
  Removing too many images breaks overlap chains.
  Only reject what is OBVIOUSLY unusable.

Three rejection reasons ONLY:
  1. Corrupt / unreadable file
  2. Severely blurry (motion blur, out of focus)
  3. Missing GPS metadata

Everything else passes.
No exposure filtering.
No contrast filtering.
No aggressive thresholds.

Applied to RGB image only.
If RGB passes → entire capture (all 5 bands) passes.
If RGB fails  → entire capture rejected.
