Stage 6, Steps 6-7 — Final bundle adjustment + GPS alignment.

Step 6 — Final BA
  After PnP registration adds non-keyframes, one full bundle adjustment
  refines all camera poses and 3D points simultaneously.

  This is the only BA that sees all images (keyframes + non-keyframes).
  All previous BA runs during incremental SfM only saw keyframes.

  Options keep the same tight filter as the incremental step.

Step 7 — GPS alignment
  pycolmap.align_reconstructions_to_locations() aligns the sparse model
  to real-world WGS84 GPS coordinates.

  For RTK path: model is already well-anchored via use_prior_position=True.
               align_reconstructions_to_locations() is a cleanup step — seconds.
  For normal GPS path: same call, but absolute accuracy is 3-5m.
                       Sufficient for NDVI + yield prediction use case.

  This is NOT a separate pipeline stage — it is a few lines at the end of
  the SfM stage. No extra time budget needed (runs in seconds).

API confirmed against pycolmap 4.0.4:
  pycolmap.bundle_adjustment(reconstruction, options)
  pycolmap.align_reconstructions_to_locations(reconstruction, ref_images_dict)
  ref_images_dict: dict[str, tuple[float, float, float]]
    key   = image name as stored in reconstruction (e.g. "000.jpg")
    value = (latitude, longitude, altitude)
